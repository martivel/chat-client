# chat-client
This is a personal test & exercise for a better understanding of Websockets.
This will be a working, but basic, chat client. All clients will be in the same room, for now.

There is a server needed for creating and managing the different websockets/connections.
The server REPO can be found here: [https://github.com/martivel/chat-server](https://github.com/martivel/chat-server)
